His graduate studies were at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received the Ph.D. degree in Physiological Optics (1975) for research on the neurophysiological mechanisms of sensitivity control in the vertebrate retina. 
During the period 1975-1983 he was a Research Fellow at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia, where he investigated the neurophysiology of retinal information processing.
From 1983-2013 he was an active member of the faculty of the School of Optometry at Indiana University USA where he is currently Professor Emeritus of Optometry and Visual Sciences.
Current research interests include optical effects on visual performance and visually-guided motor control and growth of the eye.
The American Academy of Optometry awarded Dr. Thibos the 1997 Glenn A. Fry Award for Vision Research and the 2012 Prentice Medal in recognition of contributions to advancement of knowledge in the visual sciences. 

This repository contains prof. Thibos' collected scientific publications from 1973 to 2013. More recent publications may be added in the future.
